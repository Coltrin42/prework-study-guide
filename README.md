# <Grant Coltrin's Prework Study Guide>

## Description

This study guide contains all the knowledge and information that I will not be able to squeeze into my brain over the 6 month course.

- I spent 13k on this course so I will not lose a single piece of information, so I'm writing everything in here
- This course is going at a break neck speed, and I need to be able to retain everything I possibly can.
- I will use this study guide for when I'm having a breakdown and need to go back over the information before I freak out too hard
- This study guide alone took almost 2 weeks to create. Thats ridiculous and I cant wait until I can do this all faster

## Usage

When you open the webpage, you'll see all of the beautifully crafted notes, made by yours truly. It covers topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. It will possibly have more topics, but I hope to god it doesn't. Once you enter the page, open the DevTools console, and it will list the topics we learned and randomly tell you what to do, because machines don't do that enough in this life.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests
